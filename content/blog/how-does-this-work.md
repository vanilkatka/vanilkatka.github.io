Your new blog runs on a [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/ "JAMStack"), the hottest way to blog in 2019 ðŸ˜Ž Congrats!

### _What??_

It's simple.

### Writing

You write content in Markdown. This is how Markdown looks:

```markdown
# Hello

I'm a paragraph. What about a bulleted list?

## These are a few of [my favourite things](https://genius.com/Richard-rodgers-my-favorite-things-lyrics):
* raindrops on roses
* whiskers on kittens
* bright copper kettles
* warm woolen mittens
* brown paper packages tied up with strings
```

Or if you'd prefer, you can just use a lovely WYSIWYG online editor called [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io). That's also where you manage your site.

### Managing

Open the admin UI at [https://kesselova.sk/admin](https://kesselova.sk/admin "https://kesselova.sk/admin"). The interface is pretty straightforward, I think you'll find your way around.

The source of the site lives in Github. Specifically, in the [https://github.com/rsmeral/kesselova.sk](https://github.com/rsmeral/kesselova.sk "https://github.com/rsmeral/kesselova.sk") repository. All the blog posts, CSS, and site configuration lives there.

### Hosting

The sources get buillt and deployed by [Netlify](https://netlify.com). That's also where you can configure more stuff, such as the domain name. By the way, the domain is registered by [Forpsi.com](https://www.forpsi.com/).

Enjoy your new blog! ðŸ–‹
